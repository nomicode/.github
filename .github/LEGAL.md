## General information

### Free Software

We are committed to ensuring project compliance with the [Debian Free Software Guidelines][dfsg] (DFSG) and [GNU Free Software Definition][gnu-free].

Compliance extends to:

- Anything release artefact we distribute or publish, e.g.:
  - E.g., Precompiled binaries, software packages, container images, etc.
- Any third-party works we incorporate into any release artefact

All third-party work is audited prior to inclusion, and all additional copyright and licensing information will be appended to the `NOTICE` file, along with any third-party mandatory notices.

### Reporting problems

If you spot a a licensing compliance oversight, please create a [bug report][bug-report]. Typically, these issues benefit from being discussed in the open.

For any other legal matters, please open a [blank issue][blank-issue] and use it to make a _legal contact request_. Be sure to include your contact details so that we can follow up with you privately.

We take all legal issues seriously and will endeavour to address them promptly.
