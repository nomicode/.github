# Governance

### 1. Introduction

This document defines the rules for this project. It outlines roles, responsibilities, and decision-making processes.

**Key principles:**

- Collaborative development
- Open-source friendly
- High-quality software
- Respectful interaction
- Security-focused

We value community over code. A healthy community produces good code over time.

Project direction is determined by participants. Decisions are made in public forums. There are no official leaders.

All voices are welcome. Using these rules to enforce rules without considering their spirit is unacceptable.

### 2. Roles and Responsibilities

#### 2.1. Users

Users are vital. They provide feedback and help others, becoming contributors through participation.

#### 2.2. Contributors

Anyone can contribute. No special permission needed. Sustained contributors may become collaborators.

#### 2.3. Collaborators

Collaborators are committed to the project. They gain privileges and responsibilities for project health.

Areas of contribution:

- Community management
- Project promotion
- Documentation
- Code development

Good social skills are crucial. Sustained collaborators may become project owners.

#### 2.4. Project Owners

Project owners oversee the project, ensuring adherence to governance rules and and other policies. They focus on community well-being and growth.

Responsibilities include:

- Governance
- Community management
- Release management
- Legal compliance
- Security issue handling
- Project promotion

Project owners must exemplify high standards of conduct and decision-making.

### 3. Decision Making

Preferred methods:
1. Lazy consensus
2. Discussion-led consensus

All decisions must be made in public project forums.

#### 3.1. Lazy Consensus

Assume approval unless someone objects. Create an issue for proposals and wait 72 hours for objections.

Key points:

- Most actions are reversible
- Reduces unnecessary discussion
- Silence implies agreement

#### 3.2. Discussion

If lazy consensus fails, start a discussion. Be respectful of others' time. Explain proposals clearly with justification.

For controversial ideas:

- Make proposals reversible
- Frame as experiments with clear evaluation criteria

Proceed if consensus emerges, otherwise abandon the proposal.

### 4. Conflict Resolution

If conflicts arise:
1. Attempt to resolve through respectful discussion
2. Seek mediation from uninvolved collaborators
3. Escalate to project owners if necessary

Project owners' decisions are final, but should be rare and well-justified.

### 5. Amendments

This governance document can be amended through consensus among project owners. Proposed changes should be open for community discussion before adoption.
