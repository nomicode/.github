> This document is a work in progress. Please open a [blank issue][blank issue] if you would like to suggest improvements.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it to us by opening a [draft security advisory][advisory].

If you prefer to make a confidential disclosure, please open a [blank issue][blank issue] and use it to make _security contact request_. Be sure to include your contact details so that we can follow up with you privately.

We take all security vulnerabilities seriously and will endeavour to address them promptly.

## Supported Versions

If a security vulnerability is reported or discovered, we will endeavor to publish fixes as patches to both the current release series and its immediate predecessor. For example, if the current release is 3.3.3 and the predecessor is 3.2.3, we would release versions 3.3.4 and 3.2.4.

## Security Updates

We will notify users of security updates through our standard project communication channels.
