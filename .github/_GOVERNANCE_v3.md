# Governance

## 1. Introduction

This project values community, open collaboration, and high-quality software. We make decisions through public discussions, welcoming all voices. There are no official leaders; direction is set by active participants. This governance policy guide our interactions and processes, emphasizing the spirit of cooperation over rigid rule-following.

## 2. Roles

Users provide valuable feedback and help others. Contributors actively improve the project in various ways. Collaborators, recognized for sustained contributions, gain additional privileges and responsibilities. Project Owners oversee the project's health and growth, managing governance, releases, and community well-being.

## 3. Decision Making

We prefer lazy consensus: assume approval unless someone objects within 72 hours of proposing an idea. If objections arise, we engage in open discussion to reach agreement. For controversial proposals, consider framing them as reversible experiments. Our goal is always to find solutions that benefit the project as a whole.

## 4. Conflict Resolution

When conflicts occur, parties should first attempt direct, respectful discussion. If that fails, seek mediation from uninvolved collaborators. As a last resort, Project Owners may make a final decision. Always prioritize the project's overall benefit over individual preferences.

## 5. Changes to Project Structure

New Collaborators and Project Owners are nominated based on significant contributions and commitment. Removal of privileges occurs only in cases of prolonged inactivity or serious conduct violations. All structural changes require consensus among existing Project Owners.

## 6. Amendments

This governance policy can evolve. Anyone can propose changes via project issues. After a week of open discussion, clear consensus allows implementation. For significant disagreements, Project Owners make the final call. Interpret these rules in the spirit of fostering a healthy, productive community.
