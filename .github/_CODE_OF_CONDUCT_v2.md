# Code of Conduct

## Introduction

This code of conduct governs how we behave in any project forum and whenever we will be judged by our actions. We expect it to be honored by everyone who participates in our community formally or informally, or claims any affiliation with the project.

This code applies to all spaces managed by the project, including but not limited to: GitHub repositories, issue trackers, wikis, blogs, Twitter, and any other communication channels the community uses.

## Specific Guidelines

We strive to:

1. **Be open**: We invite anyone to participate in our community. We prefer public methods of communication for project-related messages, unless discussing something sensitive.

2. **Be empathetic, welcoming, friendly, and patient**: We work together to resolve conflict, assume good intentions, and do our best to act empathetically. We don't allow frustration to turn into personal attacks.

3. **Be collaborative**: Our work will be used by other people, and we in turn will depend on the work of others. When we make something for the benefit of the project, we're willing to explain how it works, so others can build on it.

4. **Be inquisitive**: Nobody knows everything! Asking questions early avoids problems later, so we encourage questions, though they may be directed to the appropriate forum.

5. **Be careful in the words we choose**: We value professionalism in all interactions and take responsibility for our own speech. Be kind to others. Harassment and exclusionary behavior aren't acceptable.

6. **Be concise**: Keep in mind that what you write once will be read by many. Short messages mean people can understand the conversation as efficiently as possible. Bring new ideas to a conversation so that each message adds something unique.

7. **Step down considerately**: When somebody leaves or disengages from the project, we ask that they do so in a way that minimizes disruption to the project. They should tell people they are leaving and take the proper steps to ensure that others can pick up where they left off.

## Diversity Statement

This project welcomes and encourages participation by everyone. We are committed to being a community that everyone feels good about joining. We explicitly honor diversity in: age, culture, ethnicity, genotype, gender identity or expression, language, national origin, neurotype, phenotype, political beliefs, profession, race, religion, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, subculture and technical ability.

## Reporting Guidelines

If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct, we ask that you report it by contacting the project maintainers. If the violation occurs in documentation or code, for example inappropriate pronoun usage or word choice within official documentation, we ask that people report these privately to the project maintainers, and if they have sufficient ability within the project, to resolve or remove the concerning material, being mindful of the perspective of the person originally reporting the issue.

## Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behavior from any community member will not be tolerated. Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately. If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the project maintainers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning.
