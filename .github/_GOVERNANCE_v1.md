# Governance

## 1. Introduction

This document defines the governance rules under which this project operates. It outlines the roles and responsibilities within the project, how decisions are made, and how conflicts are resolved.

This document is written for anyone who wishes to participate in the project. If this is your first time through this document, read this introduction, then read all the bolded text for a summary of the governance rules. Then, as you need more detail, read past the bolded text for an expanded explanation.

We operate under a set of common principles:

- Collaborative software development
- Commercial-friendly standard license
- Consistently high quality software
- Respectful, honest, technical-based interaction
- Faithful implementation of standards
- Security as a mandatory feature

We value the community more than the code. A strong and healthy community should be a fun and rewarding place for everyone involved. Code, and everything else that goes with that code, will be produced by a healthy community over time.

The direction of the project and the decisions we make are up to you. If you are participating in project discussions, you have the right to contribute to decision-making. All decisions about the project are taken in public forums. There are no lead developers, nor is there any one person in charge.

Anyone can participate in project discussions, and in fact, you are encouraged to do so. Everybody's voice is welcome.

Finally, use of these governance rules to enforce the letter of any rule and not its spirit (also known as "rule lawyering") is not acceptable behaviour.

## 2. Roles and Responsibilities

This project defines a set of roles with associated rights and responsibilities. These roles govern what tasks an individual may perform within the project. The roles are defined in the following sections.

Your role is bestowed on you by your peers in recognition of your past contributions to the project and your position of trust within the community. It is not tied to your job, your current employer, or your current activity level. We are interested in you as an individual and we understand that your interactions with the project may change over time.

Roles are never rescinded because of inactivity, unless that inactivity is causing a problem for the project. Fortunately, our decision making process means that inactivity is very rarely a problem. Roles will be rescinded if the project owners believe the individual is no longer able to responsibly discharge the duty of the role.

We expect you to act in good faith. This is very important for a community that depends so heavily on trust.

### 2.1. Users

The most important participants in the project are people who use our software.

Users can participate by talking about the project, providing feedback, and helping others. This can be done within the project's communication channels or elsewhere, and includes being active on discussion forums, issues, and social media. Users who participate in this way automatically become contributors.

### 2.2. Contributors

A contributor is someone who makes contributions to the community, project, documentation, or code.

There is no special requirement to become a contributor. If you have a great idea for the project, you can get to work immediately. There is no need to ask permission. Most things can be accomplished by contributors with no special privileges or status on the project. Assistance can be provided if you need access to project resources to get your work done.

A contributor who makes sustained contributions to the project may be invited to become a collaborator.

### 2.3. Collaborators

A collaborator is someone who is committed to the project. In return for their commitment, they are given certain privileges within the project. Collaborators are hence responsible for the ongoing health of the project and the community.

We recognise commitment in many different areas. These include, but are not limited to:

- Community (community management, issue triage, helping new users, events etc.)
- Project (blogging, marketing, design, UX, branding, etc)
- Documentation (documentation, localisation/internationalisation, etc.)
- Code (new features, bug fixing, quality assurance, release management etc.)

If any of these things sound interesting to you, we welcome your help.

Collaborators are expected to work cooperatively and to have good social skills. This is more important than any other sort of skill. Our collaborators make up the bulk of our active community, and as such, we rely on them to help us build and maintain that community.

A collaborator who makes a sustained contribution to the project may be invited to become a project owner.

### 2.4. Project Owners

The project owners are responsible for the management of the project.

At the most basic level, the role of the project owners is oversight. The project owners must ensure that all relevant governance rules, policies, and procedures are adhered to.

Beyond this requirement, the primary goal of the project owners is to invest in the long term wellbeing of the community. For this reason, one of the most basic tasks of the project owners is the recruitment and management of project contributors. We believe that the size, diversity, and health of the community is essential for the quality, stability, and robustness of project and its social structures.

Activities of the project owners include, but are not limited to:

- Project governance
- Community management
- Release management
- Complying with legal guidelines
- Managing confidentially-reported security issues
- Branding and events coordination

Project owners are held to a much higher standard than regular community members. This includes equitable decision making and exemplary conduct. People look to project owners for cues about how to behave. It is important that all project owners understand the responsibility that they bear, and that they are individually committed to improving themselves and the project.

## 3. Decision Making

This section explains our approach to decision making and the formal structures we have in place to make this as easy as possible.

In descending order of preference, we prefer that decisions are made via:

- Lazy consensus
- Discussion-led consensus gathering

Our goal is to build a community of trust, reduce unnecessary discussion, and deal with disagreements swiftly when they occur.

All decision making must happen in public project forums. Any discussion that takes place away from these forums (for example on private chats or in person) must be brought to the public forums before anything can be decided. We have a saying: if it's not in the public forums, it didn't happen. We take this approach so that the greatest number of people have a chance to participate.

Our decision making processes are designed to reduce blockages. It is understood that people come and go as time permits. It is not practical to hear from everybody on every decision. Sometimes, this means a decision will be taken while you are away from the project. It is reasonable to bring such decisions up for discussion again, but this should be kept to a minimum.

#### 3.1. Lazy Consensus

When you are convinced that you know what the community would like to see happen, you can assume that you already have permission and get on with the work. We call this lazy consensus. You don't have to insist that people discuss or approve your plan. Just assume your plan is okay unless someone says otherwise.

"It's easier to ask forgiveness than it is to get permission." â€” Grace Hopper

Most actions are reversible. As long as you do your work in the open, the community has plenty of opportunities to object. If someone does object, you must be prepared to roll back your work.

Lazy consensus has two effects:

- People are less likely to object for the sake of it
- It cuts down on the amount of unnecessary discussion

For this to work properly, active collaborators are expected to be paying attention to the project. Objecting a long time after a change has been made may require large amounts of additional work to be thrown away or redone.

Sometimes, you might not be sure what the community would want. If this is the case, you can create an issue with an outline of what you intend to do. If nobody objects after 72 hours, you can safely assume consensus and proceed with your plan.

An important side effect of this policy is that silence is assent. There is no need for discussion, and no need for agreement to be voiced. If you make a proposal and nobody responds, that should be interpreted as implicit support for your idea, and not a lack of interest. This can be hard to get used to, but is an important part of how we do things.

### 3.2. Discussion

If lazy consensus fails (i.e. someone objects) you can start a discussion or you can abandon the proposal.

Please try to be respectful of people's time and attention. It is a non-renewable resource and the only thing we always need more of.

Proposals should be explained clearly and come with adequate justification. Disagreements should be constructive and ideally come with alternative proposals. The goal is to reach a positive outcome for the project, not convince others of your opinion.

If a proposal is particularly controversial, try making it reversible. Reframe the proposal as an experiment (either at the project level or the feature level) and identify a timeline for evaluation along with unambiguous success and failure criteria. These sorts of proposal are usually much easier to agree on.

If a clear consensus emerges, you can proceed. Otherwise, you should abandon the proposal.

## 4. Conflict Resolution

In the event that consensus cannot be reached through the normal decision-making process, the following steps should be taken:

1. The parties involved should attempt to resolve the conflict through respectful discussion and compromise.
2. If direct discussion fails, seek mediation from uninvolved collaborators or project owners.
3. As a last resort, project owners may make a final decision to resolve the conflict.

It's important to remember that the goal is always to reach a solution that benefits the project as a whole, rather than any individual's personal preferences.

## 5. Changes to Project Structure

### 5.1. Adding New Collaborators

When a contributor has made significant and sustained contributions to the project, they may be nominated to become a collaborator. This process typically involves:

1. A current collaborator or project owner nominating the contributor.
2. Discussion among existing collaborators and project owners about the nomination.
3. If there's consensus, the contributor is invited to become a collaborator.

### 5.2. Removing Collaborators

In rare cases, it may be necessary to remove a collaborator's privileges. This should only be done if:

1. The collaborator has been inactive for an extended period and is unresponsive to attempts at communication.
2. The collaborator has repeatedly violated the project's code of conduct or governance rules.
3. 
The decision to remove a collaborator should be made through consensus among project owners.

### 5.3. Adding New Project Owners

Similar to adding collaborators, new project owners are selected from among collaborators who have demonstrated exceptional commitment to the project. The process involves:

1. Nomination by an existing project owner.
2. Discussion among current project owners.
3. Consensus agreement among project owners.

### 5.4. Removing Project Owners

Removing a project owner is a serious matter and should only be considered in extreme circumstances, such as:

1. Prolonged inactivity and unresponsiveness.
2. Serious violations of the project's principles or code of conduct.

The decision requires consensus among all other project owners.

## 6. Amendments to Governance Rules

These governance rules are not set in stone. They can be amended as the project evolves and new needs arise. The process for amending this document is as follows:

1. Any project participant can propose changes to the governance rules.
2. The proposal should be made as an issue in the project repository.
3. The proposal will be open for discussion for at least one week.
4. If there's clear consensus for the change, it can be implemented.
5. If there's significant disagreement, project owners will make the final decision.

Remember, the goal of this governance document is to facilitate smooth operation of the project and foster a healthy community. It should be interpreted in that spirit.
